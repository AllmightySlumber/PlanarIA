This project is one I've done with a classmate for our Introduction to Artificial Intelligence class and in collaboration with some other students from the 
Biology licence. The goal of this project was to give us a foretaste of how professional of the AI domain work in collaboration with professional from the 
environmental domain such as biologists.

The work was divided as such:
The biologist make the experiments as gets the data. They provide the data to us computer scientists and they analyse the data to get the get the information
they need.
Us (computer scientists) clean the data and then analyse it the get the information we need. Afterward we've created some learning models to train on the 
dataset we got and evaluate the models on the the dataset also.

The experiment of the biologist was the following:
They put an earthworm called "Planaire" in french (sorry i didn't find a translation for it) in a dish with a solution made of water and a liquid form 
molecule among 4 molecules. They put a squared paper under the dish. Then they start a timer and write down how much square the worm have crossed (to measure its movement). They do so for each molecule 3 times or so.

And for our part, we tried to train classifier models to recognize the molecules given the behavior. All the process is in the LocomotionPlanaire.ipynb.
